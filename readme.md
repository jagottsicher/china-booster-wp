## Participation in project development

The best way for ordinary users to participate in the development of a project is to help promote it and participate in [translation contribution][3].

If you have a good idea, or are interested in participating in project development, you can join the project communication QQ group: 1046115671

I think, for college students, participating in an open source project is undoubtedly the best way to accumulate development experience. At the same time, the work is not completely unpaid, and the project sponsors will provide periodic financial support for each developer as appropriate.
