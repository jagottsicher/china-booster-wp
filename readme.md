# wordpress-china

## Introduction
wordpress-chian forked from [litepress/wp-china-yes](https://github.com/litepress/wp-china-yes), a project of WP China Localization Community ([WP-China.org]) which aims at connection your in China hosted WordPress installation to a domestically (China) hosted ecosystem to access downloads and services faster and more reliable.

The project looked pretty abandoned (website not accessable, no translation available) but promising. So here's a pretty neat to English translated fork.

You can choose from three ways to give feedback on your issue.

## Participation in project development

The best way for ordinary users to participate in the development of a project is to help promote it and participate in [translation contribution][3].

If you have a good idea, or are interested in participating in project development, you can join the project communication QQ group: 1046115671

I think, for college students, participating in an open source project is undoubtedly the best way to accumulate development experience. At the same time, the work is not completely unpaid, and the project sponsors will provide periodic financial support for each developer as appropriate.
