# WordPress China Booster
A plugin to connect your WordPress installation in China to a domestically (in China) hosted ecosystem to access downloads and services faster and more reliable

## Introduction
**WordPress China Booster** forked from [litepress/wp-china-yes](https://github.com/litepress/wp-china-yes), a project of WP China Localization Community ([WP-China.org]) which aims at connecting your WordPress installation in China to a domestically (in China) hosted ecosystem to access downloads and services faster and more reliable.

The project looked pretty abandoned (website not accessable, no translation (or service for) available) but like a promising approach. So here's a pretty neat to English translated fork.

## Installation

If you want to use a release from this fork in a production environment you can find the latest version in the [Release List][1]. Download the zip file and visit [https://www.your-domain.com/wp-admin/plugin-install.php][2] directly, click "Upload Plugin" at the top left corner of the page to upload and install it. Choose the zip file to upload and eventually click "Install Now".
